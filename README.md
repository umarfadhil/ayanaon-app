## What is AyaNaon-app?

AyaNaon-app (which roughly translates to "What's up?" or "What's happening?" in Sundanese) is a platform where users can drop "pins" on a map to highlight various events, deals, traffic updates, lost and found items, and more. It's built to foster local engagement and keep everyone informed about what's happening around them.

## Key Features

*   **Interactive Map:** Explore your local area with an intuitive Google Maps interface.
*   **Pin Dropping:** Easily add new pins to the map with a title, detailed description, category, and an optional external link. You can even set an expiration time for your pins!
*   **Category Filtering:** Quickly find what you're looking for by filtering pins based on different categories like "Events," "Food & Drink Promos," "Traffic & Accidents," and more.
*   **Community Engagement:** Upvote or downvote pins to show your support or disagreement.
*   **Location Services:** Find your current location on the map with a single click.
*   **Pin Management:** Reporters can edit their own pins, ensuring information stays accurate.
*   **Real-time Updates:** See the number of active pins and unique contributors in real-time.
*   **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience whether you're on your desktop or mobile phone.
*   **Gerobak Online Mode:** Vendors can broadcast a live location, showcase a full profile with optional WhatsApp contact, collect "Verified by Warga" badges from customer votes, and manage their storefront directly on the map (edit details, control phone privacy, upload a menu gallery).

## How It Works (Under the Hood)

AyaNaon-app is a modern web application built with:

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing the Google Maps JavaScript API for the interactive map.
*   **Backend:** Powered by Netlify Functions (serverless functions) using Node.js and Express.js.
*   **Database:** MongoDB for storing all pin data, user IP addresses (anonymously), and other application information.

## Getting Started

To get the app up and running, you'll need to:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/umarfadhil/ayanaon-app.git
    cd ayanaon-app
    ```
2.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    You'll need a `.env` file in your project root with:
    *   `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
    *   `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: Your Google Maps JavaScript API key.
    *   `JWT_SECRET`: Secret used to sign seller login tokens.
    *   `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_FROM` *(optional)*: Required to deliver WhatsApp verification codes via Twilio's API. When omitted, codes are surfaced in the API response for local testing.
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Deploy to Netlify:** This app is designed for easy deployment on Netlify. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify, and it will automatically build and deploy your functions and frontend.

## Gerobak Online Workflow

1. **Register:** Visit `register.html`, fill out stall details, upload a main cart photo (max 1 MB), and optionally add up to three menu photos before accepting the broadcast terms.
2. **Verify WhatsApp:** A 6-digit code is sent to the registered WhatsApp number (via Twilio when credentials are available). In development environments without Twilio, the code also appears in the API response.
3. **Go Live:** Sign in through `login.html`, enable Gerobak Online from the map panel when you are ready to broadcast, and watch the live cart counter update in real time.
4. **Manage Profile:** Update the name, brand, description, hero photo, menu gallery, and phone visibility directly from the map interface.
5. **Earn Community Trust:** Happy customers can vote through the marker popup to award the "Verified by Warga" badge.

Active Gerobak Online carts appear as dedicated markers with full profiles, optional menu galleries, and a WhatsApp link (when enabled) so residents can reach vendors instantly.
